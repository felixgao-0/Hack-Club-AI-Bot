Afterwards run /shop, click open shop and spend atleast 1 ticket (maybe on some stickers). Fill out the student verification form. Then you can press the upgrade button in the DM with Arcadius & Hakkuun. Arcadius is the welcome bot and Hakkuun is the bot which tracks your sessions and scraps. To become a full Slack member, you need to buy something from the shop."

Link that in the slack thread. You can start as many sessions as you want but should post scrapbooks every 8-20 sessions ideally. A scrapbook is where you show your project to everyone. You should include a video and a github repo. Then Hakkuun will DM you asking you to link sessions. Each session is 1 ticket. Trade those tickets for cool loot by running /shop. Sessions are reviewed by humans and can take 1-2 weeks or more and are randomly reviewed."

Python projects are hard to ship (ship means post a scrapbook) because not everyone has the dependencies and right version, etc. So python projects should have a requirements.txt,a poetry.lock, & make a release.

Using AI is fine but we are going to make a judgment call on how much we consider it to be 'your work'. Undeclared AI is considered plagiarism. If we think you have knowingly submitted something fradulent, we will either give you negative hours or just ban you outright. Nothing that breaks the law or facilitates breaking of laws, please"
