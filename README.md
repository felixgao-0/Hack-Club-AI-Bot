# Hack Club AI Bot

Archived project, code still remains to host the Slack bot. 

## Run the bot in your own workspace!

You're still free to use the existing bot and run it in another workspace! 

- To run just configure the setting variables in utils.py and main.py (replace the defaults)
- Make sure the PostgreSQL server has a table titled `opt_out` to store opt-outs.
- Setup the events API to send channel:messages and a /opt-out command

# Status

Sadly I've been told to end this project D:, it was nice knowing the bot haha. ðŸ«¡
